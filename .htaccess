# The line just below this section: 'Options +FollowSymLinks' may cause problems
# with some server configurations.  It is required for use of mod_rewrite, but may already
# be set by your server administrator in a way that dissallows changing it in
# your .htaccess file.  If using it causes your server to error out, comment it out (add # to
# beginning of line), reload your site in your browser and test your sef url's.  If they work,
# it has been set by your server administrator and you do not need it set here.

## Can be commented out if causes errors, see notes above.

# Block out any script that includes a <script> tag in URL.
# Block out any script trying to set a PHP GLOBALS variable via URL.
# Block out any script trying to modify a _REQUEST variable via URL.
# Return 403 Forbidden header and show the content of the root homepage
